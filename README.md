# Form Wave Annimation Project

This project involved building a simple login form with a wave effect on the labels. The letters of the label go up in a wave-like fashion when a field is clicked, and return to their original positions when the cursor clicks elsewhere.

## Objective
* Using JavaScript, wrap a span around each label.
* In CSS, add a transition so that the label moves up when focusing on the input.
* Also add dynamic transition delay for the letters' wave effect.
